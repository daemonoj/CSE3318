 1 - load from file. It will read from file and create 2 linked lists, L1 and L2. If L1 and L2 exist, they are first destroyed and then they are recreated with data from the file  .
 2 - check that list L1 is sorted in increasing order.
 3 - merge L1 with L2 and print the resulting list, L1. The result list will be referenced from variable L1. It should check that BOTH lists are sorted in increasing order in order for the merge to work.
 4 - remove duplicates from L1. (this method will assumes L1 is sorted in increasing order.)
 5 - print lists L1 and L2.
 6 - destroy L1 and L2 (and free the memory). If L1 and L2 are NULL it should not crash.
 0 - exit.
